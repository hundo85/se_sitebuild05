        <h2>Emergence of scaling in random networks</h2>

        <p>
          Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the world wide web are best described asnetworks with complex
          topology. A common property of many large networks is that thevertex connectivities follow a scale-free
          power-law distribution. This feature is found to bea consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks
          expand continuously by theaddition of new vertices, and new vertices attach preferentially to already well
          connectedsites. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces theobserved stationary scale-free
          distributions, indicating that the development of large networks is governed by robustself-organizing
          phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.

        <h2>Statistical mechanics of complex networks</h2>
        <h6>A.-L. Barabási, R. Albert / Reviews of Modern Physics 74, 47-97 (202)</h6>
        <p>
          Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society, much quoted examples including the
          cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, or the Internet, a network of routers and computers
          connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems were modeled as random graphs, it is
          increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks is governed by robust organizing
          principles. Here we review the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical
          mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent
          interest in networks, we discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and
          scale-free networks, as well as the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures
          and attacks.
